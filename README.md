# Multi-Agent Search: Pacman with Ghosts

## Introduction
This project involves designing agents for a multi-agent version of Pacman, where Pacman must navigate the maze while being pursued by ghosts. I implemented several adversarial search algorithms, including Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Expectimax, along with an improved evaluation function to enhance Pacman's decision-making abilities.

## Q1: Reflex Agent
Implemented a reflex agent that evaluates state-action pairs to make decisions. The agent considers the locations of food and ghosts, attempting to maximize score while avoiding danger. The agent successfully performs well on `testClassic` layout.

### Execution Commands:
```bash
python pacman.py -p ReflexAgent -l testClassic
python pacman.py -p ReflexAgent -k 1 --frameTime 0
python pacman.py -p ReflexAgent -k 2 --frameTime 0
```

## Q2: Minimax
Developed a Minimax agent that assumes ghosts play optimally. The agent recursively explores the game tree up to a given depth, selecting moves that minimize the worst-case outcome.

### Execution Commands:
```bash
python pacman.py -p MinimaxAgent -l minimaxClassic -a depth=4
python autograder.py -q q2 --no-graphics
```

## Q3: Alpha-Beta Pruning
Optimized the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to reduce the number of states explored, leading to improved performance.

### Execution Commands:
```bash
python pacman.py -p AlphaBetaAgent -a depth=3 -l smallClassic
python autograder.py -q q3 --no-graphics
```

## Q4: Expectimax
Implemented the Expectimax algorithm to model the probabilistic behavior of ghosts. Unlike Minimax, this approach does not assume the worst-case scenario but rather considers the expected utility of each move.

### Execution Commands:
```bash
python pacman.py -p ExpectimaxAgent -l minimaxClassic -a depth=3
python autograder.py -q q4 --no-graphics
```

## Q5: Evaluation Function
Developed a more sophisticated evaluation function that evaluates states rather than actions, improving Pacmanâ€™s decision-making abilities. The function considers factors such as proximity to food, ghosts, and power pellets.

### Execution Commands:
```bash
python autograder.py -q q5 --no-graphics
```
